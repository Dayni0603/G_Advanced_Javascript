## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Movie Recommendation App**
   - Description: The Movie Recommendation App is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to browse and filter movies by name and genre.
                  It is built using pure JavaScript (without frameworks) to demonstrate higher-order functions, closures, and async/await.
   - Technologies: JavaScript.

2. **Project 2: 3.1: Functional Programming Paradigms**
   - Description: This mini project demonstrates core functional programming paradigms in JavaScript using a simple name formatting use case. The code illustrates how to use pure functions, higher-order 
                  functions, function composition, closures, and partial application to create reusable, modular utilities for transforming user input. For example, it shows how to build a composed function to 
                  clean and format a name, use closures to create custom prefix functions, and apply partial application to fix certain arguments in advance. This approach promotes clarity, reusability, and 
                  separation of concernsâ€”key functional programming principles.
   - Technologies: JavaScript (ES6+)
                   Functional programming:
                   Pure functions (trimString, toLowerCase, addPriFix)
                   Function composition (compose)
                   Closures (addCustomPrefix)
                   Partial application (partialApplay)
