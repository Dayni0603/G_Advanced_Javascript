## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Movie Recommendation App**
   - Description: The Movie Recommendation App is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to browse and filter movies by name and genre.
                  It is built using pure JavaScript (without frameworks) to demonstrate higher-order functions, closures, and async/await.
   - Technologies: JavaScript.

2. **Project 2: 1.2: Functional Programming Paradigms**
   - Description: This mini project demonstrates core functional programming paradigms in JavaScript using a simple name formatting use case. The code illustrates how to use pure functions, higher-order 
                  functions, function composition, closures, and partial application to create reusable, modular utilities for transforming user input. For example, it shows how to build a composed function to 
                  clean and format a name, use closures to create custom prefix functions, and apply partial application to fix certain arguments in advance. This approach promotes clarity, reusability, and 
                  separation of concerns—key functional programming principles.
   - Technologies: JavaScript (ES6+)

                   Functional programming:

                   - Pure functions (trimString, toLowerCase, addPriFix)

                   - Function composition (compose)

                   - Closures (addCustomPrefix)

                   - Partial application (partialApply)


3. **Project 3: 1.2 Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Features – User Info Formatter**
   - Description: This project demonstrates modern JavaScript (ES6+) syntax and features through a simple user information formatter. It showcases how to use object destructuring with default values, the rest 
                  parameter to collect remaining properties, and the spread operator to clone and update objects immutably. The function displayUserInfo takes a user object and neatly extracts key properties 
                  while preserving flexibility for any additional fields. This approach improves code readability and reduces boilerplate, aligning with modern JavaScript best practices.
   - Technologies: JavaScript (ES6+)
                   Modern language features:

                  ✅ Destructuring with defaults: { name = "Guest", age = 18 }
                  ✅ Rest parameters: ...rest for additional properties
                  ✅ Spread operator: ...user to clone and override properties

4. **Project 4: 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming Principles – Bank Account System**
   - Description: This project demonstrates the four core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)—Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—using a simple bank account system built in 
                  JavaScript.
                  The BankAccount class encapsulates balance data using getters and setters, and abstracts the logic of deposit and withdrawal operations. The SavingsAccount class extends BankAccount, showcasing 
                  inheritance and method overriding (polymorphism) with a custom withdrawal limit. A method for adding interest is also included to highlight class-specific functionality. This code offers a clean 
                  and practical demonstration of how OOP supports code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
   - Technologies: JavaScript (ES6+)

                 Object-Oriented Programming:

                  ✅ Encapsulation: _balance as a pseudo-private property with getter/setter
                  ✅ Abstraction: deposit() and withdraw() methods hiding logic from external use
                  ✅ Inheritance: SavingsAccount inherits from BankAccount
                  ✅ Polymorphism: SavingsAccount overrides the withdraw() method

5. **Project 5: 3.3 Reactive Task Management System (Pure JavaScript + RxJS)**
   - Description: This is a Trello-like task management app built using vanilla JavaScript and RxJS. It supports task creation, editing, drag-and-drop between columns (todo, in-progress, done), and persistent 
                  state using localStorage. It also introduces a reactive store using BehaviorSubject, making state changes immediately reflected in the DOM.
                  and practical demonstration of how OOP supports code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
   - Technologies: JavaScript (ES6+)

                 The app demonstrates:

                  ✅ Modern Object-Oriented JavaScript
                  ✅ Reactive programming using RxJS (BehaviorSubject)
                  ✅ Drag-and-drop functionality
                  ✅ DOM manipulation without any frameworks
                  ✅ Clean separation of concerns using utility methods and modular logic
